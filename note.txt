Complexity in Big O

-O(1)
-O(log n)
-O(n)
-O(n log n)
-O(n^2)
-O(2^n)



Complexity 0(1)
Means it take sone step to complete
A = b+c
C= 1+8

**Complexity 0(log n)
	times goes up linearly and n goes up exponentially 
	1 sec to compute 10 element : 10^1
	2 sec to compute 100 element  : 10^2
	3 sec to compute 1000 element   : 10^3

	for(int i=1;i<=n;i=i*3){
	print"hello";
	}
	log base 3


** Complexity 0(n)
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		print"hello";
}


** Complexity O(n log n)
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){     n
	for(int j = 1;j<n;j=j*2){
		print"hello";
	}
}

**Complexity 0(n^2)
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
	for (int j = 0; j < n; j = j + 2){
	print("Hello");
	}
}


Complexity O(2^n)
int fibonacci(int number){
if(number <= 1)return number;
return fibonacci (number -2)+ fibonacci (number-1);
}

Big O is the worst scenario


Array
int takes 4 bytes


What does it mean when we say that an algorithm A is asymptotically more efficient than B?
it means A would be a better choice for all inputs except small inputs


Linked List 
It solves the limitation problem of the array., arrays are defined to size
with link list it uses a pointer to point to the next element 

[n] > [a] > [b] > [c] > [d] null
[0]   [10]  [15]  [67]  [10]
[a]   [b]   [c]   [d]   [null]

each above is a node

there are 3 types of linked list 
- singly linked list
- double linked list 
- circular linked list 

_singly linked list 
it has two modules, it has value module and the next module that point to the next value module in the list
first node is head node 
class Node{
	int value;
	Node next;
}

-double linked list 
unlike the singly linked list has 3 modules. one for the value, another is the pointer to the next item in the list and the
other is the channel to the previous value in the list.
class Node{
int v;
Node prev;
Node next;
}

a memory effcient Doubly linked list also know as XOR linked list 
instead of 3 sections a XOR linked list has only 2 sections 





linked list vs array 
linked are better
-if you need constant insertion and deletion from the list 
- if you dont know how many children will be in the list 
- you dont need random access to any element 
- you want to be able to insert items in the middle of list


array are better if 
- you need indexed/ random access to the element 
- you know the number of elements in the array
- you need the speed when iterating through all the elements in the sequence
- memory is a concern (array are mo)


Circular linked list is a list where all the nodes are connected to form a circle.




------------------------
Hash Table (AKA Hash Map) 
-------------------------
Hash table is a data strucutre it is used to store key value pair. 
Data is stored in array format. each data value is its own unique unique index value.

C# has dictionary, StringDictionary, HashTable

int hash(string key){
//lets say we pass Italy
//first convert each of them to ascii
I = 73;
t = 116;
a = 97;
l = 108
y  = 121;
total 515;
index = hashcode % sizeOfArray  = 515 % 6 = 5;

}
Hash a=function should be simple
should return the sme result for the same input

Handling Collision 
- seperate chaining 
- open addressing 


seperate chaining 
AB -> index 1
Bb -> 4
PR-> 2;
Ca -> 4

since Bb and  Ca are both 4, we can use array or linked list data structure to store data on original array
so at index 4, we store 1 linked list object then the original element is added to the linked list then the new value 
is added to the next node on the linked list.


Open Addressing 
AB -> index 1
Bb -> 4
PR-> 2;
Ca -> 4

it will store in the next availbale free space , since index 4 is already occupied , it takes it to 5 , if 5 is not free, and that is the last index of the array, it moves back to the beginning,   


Stacks
is a data structure , element last is access first 

stack uses LIFO(Last In First Out) and FILO(First In Last Out) pattern
push and pop

top - shows the element at the top
size - shows the number of elements stored in the stack

9
7
2 
5 

()
underflow - trying to pop out an element from an empty stack 
overflow - trying to push an element into a full stack


Queue 
is a linear structure. First in First Out(FIFO) and LILO

Empty Queue
rear
[]  []  []  []  []
front

					 rear
 [0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]
front
